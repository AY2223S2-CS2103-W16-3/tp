### Project: PlanEase

PlanEase is designed for event planners who prefer typing on their keyboards to retrieve information quickly.
It provides a centralised platform for them to manage their work, contacts, and event information.
This application helps to streamline the process of searching for stakeholders' contact information and keeping track of important events.
